# YALTA project backend based on play-scala-slick-example

YALTA stands for Yet Another Logistics Tracking App

<https://github.com/playframework/play-scala-isolated-slick-example/>

Contains git submodule with common data model code, to properly clone this use
`git clone --recurse-submodules`

 Latest version available at heroku: https://yalta-backend.herokuapp.com/
 
Autodeploy is not available yet since GH integration does not work with submodules and it requires workarounds
